# Getting Started with Markdown Blogging

Welcome to my first blog post! In this article, I'll demonstrate various Markdown features that you can use in your blog posts.

## Text Formatting

You can write text in **bold**, *italic*, or ***both***. You can also add `inline code` using backticks.

## Lists

Here's an unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a [link](https://example.com)

And a numbered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Blocks

Here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> Perfect for highlighting important information or quotes.

## Images

You can add images like this (add your image path):
