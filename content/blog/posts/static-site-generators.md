# Why Static Site Generators Are Making a Comeback

In an era of complex web applications and dynamic content, static site generators (SSGs) are experiencing a renaissance. Let's explore why they're becoming increasingly popular.

## The Benefits of Static Sites

### 1. Performance
Static sites are blazing fast because:
- No database queries
- No server-side rendering
- Content can be served from CDNs
- Minimal JavaScript overhead

### 2. Security
With no dynamic content or database:
- Reduced attack surface
- No need to worry about SQL injection
- Less vulnerable to common exploits

### 3. Scalability
Static sites are incredibly scalable:
```text
                   ┌─────────┐
                   │   CDN   │
                   └─────────┘
                        │
┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│  User   │ ──── │  Edge   │ ──── │ Static  │
│         │      │ Server  │      │ Storage │
└─────────┘      └─────────┘      └─────────┘
```

## Modern Static Site Tools

Here's a simple example using Node.js:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const marked = require('marked');

// Convert Markdown to HTML
function buildPage(markdown) {
    return marked.parse(markdown);
}

// Generate static files
function build() {
    const content = fs.readFileSync('content.md', 'utf8');
    const html = buildPage(content);
    fs.writeFileSync('dist/index.html', html);
}
```

## When to Use Static Sites

Static sites are perfect for:
- Blogs and personal websites
- Documentation
- Marketing sites
- Portfolio websites

## The Future is Static (and Dynamic)

The future of web development isn't about choosing between static and dynamic—it's about using the right tool for the job. Static site generators give us the best of both worlds: the simplicity of static files with the power of modern build tools.
